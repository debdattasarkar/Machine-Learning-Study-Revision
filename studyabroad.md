Thank you so much for sharing those details â€” that really helps me understand your situation and tailor a plan that fits your background and aspirations.

Hereâ€™s a quick summary of where youâ€™re at:

Academic background: Masterâ€™s in Computer Application (great foundation!)

Target countries: UK, Switzerland (Zurich), and New Zealand â€” all excellent choices with strong ML research communities.

Research experience: None yet, but youâ€™re motivated to get started (perfectly fine â€” weâ€™ll make a plan for that).

ML interests: You have a sense of what areas in ML interest you (thatâ€™s a big plus!).

Primary concern: Financial cost â€” very valid, and many scholarship routes are available.

Step 1: Build a Strong Research Profile (Start Now)

Even without prior research, you can take active steps to strengthen your academic CV:

âœ… Online Courses & Projects:

Take advanced courses in ML (e.g., deep learning, reinforcement learning, probabilistic models) from platforms like Coursera, edX, or Fast.ai.

Work on self-initiated projects or open-source contributions and publish them on GitHub.


âœ… Research Assistantship or Collaborations:

Reach out to your former professors or local researchers in ML and offer to help with their research.

Try to co-author at least one paper (even a workshop paper or preprint on arXiv is a solid start).


âœ… Write a Technical Blog:

Start a blog where you explain ML concepts or summarize research papers. It builds credibility and demonstrates passion.

Step 2: Identify Programs and Supervisors (Research-Based PhDs)

Since you're looking at the UK, Switzerland (Zurich), and New Zealand, here are top institutions and how they typically structure their PhD programs:

ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ United Kingdom

Top Universities: University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, University of Edinburgh, University of Warwick.

Funding: Look for Doctoral Training Programs (DTPs), EPSRC-funded studentships, or individual scholarships (like Commonwealth PhD Scholarships, Rhodes (for certain countries), or university-specific PhD funding).

Approach: In the UK, you usually apply directly to a supervisor or a lab, so identify 3â€“5 professors whose work aligns with your interests and write tailored emails expressing interest.


ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ Switzerland (Zurich)

Top University: ETH Zurich (world-renowned in ML, AI, and computer vision).

Funding: ETH offers fully funded PhD positions. You donâ€™t pay tuition, and you get a monthly salary.

Approach: Search for open PhD positions on the ETH Zurich job portal or specific lab websites (e.g., Prof. Andreas Krauseâ€™s Learning & Adaptive Systems Group). Apply directly with a strong research proposal.


ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¿ New Zealand

Top Universities: University of Auckland, University of Otago, Victoria University of Wellington.

Funding: Many NZ universities offer fully funded PhD scholarships, even for international students â€” such as the University of Auckland Doctoral Scholarship.

Approach: Similar to the UK â€” reach out to potential supervisors with a research proposal and apply for university scholarships.

Step 3: Prepare Your Application Materials

Youâ€™ll need the following:

âœ… Statement of Purpose (SOP) â€” Explain your academic background, motivation, research interests, and why you're applying to this particular university/supervisor.

âœ… Research Proposal â€” Especially in the UK and NZ, this is key. You donâ€™t need it to be perfect at first â€” I can help you draft it when you're ready.

âœ… CV â€” Highlight academic achievements, programming skills, and any ML-related work or projects.

âœ… Letters of Recommendation â€” 2â€“3 strong academic references. If you assist in any research, ask that professor to write one.

âœ… English Proficiency â€” If required, prepare for and take IELTS or TOEFL.

Step 4: Scholarships and Financial Planning

Since finances are a concern, focus on fully funded PhD programs, and consider:

1. UK:

Check FindAPhD.com for funded positions.

Explore Commonwealth Scholarship (if you're from a Commonwealth country).

University funding: Most major UK universities have internal scholarships.



2. Switzerland (ETH Zurich):

PhDs are salaried positions â€” no separate scholarship application needed.



3. New Zealand:

Universities often waive international tuition for PhD students.

Look at scholarships like:

University of Otago Doctoral Scholarship

Victoria Doctoral Scholarship

Auckland Doctoral Scholarship

Step 5: Timeline and Strategy

Hereâ€™s a rough timeline:

Timeframe	Action

Next 3â€“6 months	Build research experience, finalize area of interest, reach out to potential supervisors
6â€“9 months from now	Prepare documents (CV, SOP, research proposal), take English test if needed
9â€“12 months from now	Apply for programs and scholarships
12â€“18 months from now	Begin PhD abroad!

Would you like help identifying specific supervisors or open PhD positions in any of these countries?

Also, do you want to revise or add anything to this plan â€” like adding another country or focusing more on research preparation?

Once you're happy with the plan, I can also share some tips for handling common challenges during a PhD abroad (like managing finances or adapting to new academic environments).
