### üß† **Unsupervised Learning ‚Äî Explained**

#### üìò Definition:

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on data **without labeled outputs**. The system is not told what the "correct answer" is, and it attempts to find **patterns, groupings, or structure** in the data on its own.

---

### üîç Key Points:

* **No prior labels:** The data does not include the "correct" output.
* **Goal:** Discover hidden structure or relationships among features.
* **No feedback:** There‚Äôs no evaluation signal (e.g., no "right" or "wrong" during training).

---

### üß™ Examples:

#### ‚úÖ **Clustering Example:**

> Grouping 1,000,000 different genes based on characteristics like lifespan, location, or biological function ‚Äî **without knowing the group labels in advance**.

This is typical in:

* Gene expression analysis
* Market segmentation
* Customer profiling

#### ‚úÖ **Non-Clustering Example:**

> **"Cocktail Party Algorithm"** ‚Äî separates overlapping voices and music from a noisy environment using patterns in sound waves (also known as **Blind Source Separation**).

---

### üìé Takeaway:

Unsupervised learning is useful when:

* You want to **explore data**.
* There are **no labeled outcomes**.
* You're interested in discovering **hidden patterns**, not predicting predefined labels.

### üß† **Which of the following are Unsupervised Learning Problems?**

#### ‚úÖ Correct Answers:

1. **"Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into sets of articles about the same stories."**

   * **Explanation:** This is a classic **clustering** task with **no predefined labels**.
   * You are grouping similar data points ‚Äî unsupervised.

2. **"Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments."**

   * **Explanation:** Also a **clustering problem**, common in marketing analytics.
   * No labels are given; the algorithm learns patterns in structure ‚Äî **unsupervised**.

---

#### ‚ùå Incorrect Answers:

1. **"Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter."**

   * **Explanation:** This is a **supervised learning** task.
   * Labels (spam/not spam) are provided.

2. **"Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not."**

   * **Explanation:** Another **supervised classification** problem.
   * The presence or absence of diabetes is a labeled outcome.

### üßæ Summary

| Example                                                         | Type of Learning | Why?                            |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Grouping news articles                                          | Unsupervised     | No labels; natural grouping     |
| Market segmentation from customer data                          | Unsupervised     | No predefined classes           |
| Learning a spam filter from labeled data                        | Supervised       | Uses known labels               |
| Classifying patients as diabetic/non-diabetic from labeled data | Supervised       | Predicts labeled class (0 or 1) |
