Great question. Despite **GELU** and **Swish** outperforming **ReLU** in many modern deep models like Transformers and EfficientNet, they are **not commonly used in traditional Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)**. Here‚Äôs why:

---

## üîç Why GELU & Swish Are Rare in Classical DNNs

### 1. **Computational Complexity**

* **ReLU**: Just `max(0, x)` ‚Äî extremely cheap and fast.
* **Swish**: $x \cdot \text{sigmoid}(x)$ ‚Äî includes exponentials.
* **GELU**: $x \cdot \Phi(x) \approx x \cdot \text{tanh polynomial}$ ‚Äî even more math-heavy.

> üß† In dense MLPs with millions of neurons, the cumulative cost of Swish/GELU slows training ‚Äî especially when hardware isn‚Äôt optimized for these ops.

---

### 2. **Hardware/Framework Optimization**

* Deep learning frameworks and hardware (TPUs, GPUs) **are highly optimized for ReLU**.
* Swish and GELU often require fallback to slower kernel ops or approximations (unless using XLA or special graph optimizers).

---

### 3. **Diminishing Returns in Shallow DNNs**

* Swish/GELU shine in **very deep networks** where smooth gradients matter.
* In shallow or mid-depth DNNs (e.g. 3‚Äì10 layers), **ReLU is usually ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù** and trains faster.
* Classic DNNs like those used in tabular data or MLPs often don't benefit noticeably.

---

### 4. **ReLU‚Äôs Simplicity and Proven Track Record**

* Since AlexNet (2012), ReLU has been the **default go-to**.
* Community inertia: tools, papers, tutorials, benchmarks all rely on ReLU.

| Activation | Excels In                           |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Swish**  | Image classification (EfficientNet) |
| **GELU**   | NLP (BERT, GPT), Transformers       |
| **ReLU**   | Classical MLPs, tabular DNNs, CNNs  |

| Reason                         | Impact                                  |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| üßÆ High compute cost           | Slower training in large dense networks |
| ‚öôÔ∏è Hardware not optimized      | Less efficient than ReLU                |
| üîç Not needed for shallow nets | Gains are minimal in traditional DNNs   |
| üìö Community inertia           | ReLU remains a solid baseline           |
